# A repo to practice AR App development 

### 1. [My first AR App using unity.](https://github.com/parthit/ARApps-/tree/master/UNO_AR) It plays an animation of a 3D model on top of the target image
### 2. [An AR Book App.](https://github.com/parthit/ARApps-/tree/master/BOOK_AR) It plays unique animations and effects on different target images. It demonstrates a use case that could make learning interesting. Could be potentially used for Textbooks interesting.
### 3. [Trying out Virtual Buttons](https://github.com/parthit/ARApps-/tree/master/SimpleVirtualButtonDemo) It is my first attempt at using Virtual Buttons.
### 4. [Using Virtual Buttons to play a video of my best friends and I.](https://github.com/parthit/ARApps-/tree/master/MyFriends) The App plays a video of Aditi, Ria and myself when the corresponding virtual button is pressed (coved). Potential use case of making learning interesting by incorporating it with Textbooks.


There are a couple of other AR Project as well, but I don't think they are significant enough. The ones mentioned above are the ones I'm proud of
