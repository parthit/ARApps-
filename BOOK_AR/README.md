# BOOK AR APP

This is a basic prototype of a project I want to build to make studies more interesting for elementary grade students.
Instead of the drawings that I made, I aim to use pictures of specific textbook pages and adding pertinent models and animations regarding that page and subject.

To test the App, open the images in the [ImageTarget folder](https://github.com/parthit/ARApps-/tree/master/BOOK_AR/ImageTargets) and scan the images using the Andorid App after installing it using the [APK file](https://github.com/parthit/ARApps-/blob/master/BOOK_AR/BOOK_AR.apk) provided.

## Using Unity 2019.4.8f1 and Vuforia 8.5.9
