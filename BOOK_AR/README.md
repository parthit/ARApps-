# BOOK AR APP

This is a basic prototype of a project I want to build to make studies more interesting for elementary grade students.
Instead of the drawing that I made, aim to use pictures of specific textbook pages and adding pertinent models and animations regarding that page.

## Using Unity 2019.4.8f1 and Vuforia 8.5.9
