# A project to demonstrate how to recognise mutliple image targets at once.

## Also plays audio when the app recognises an Image Target.

Download the install the [APK file](https://github.com/parthit/ARApps-/blob/master/GREETINGCARD/GREETINGCARD.apk), go to [this folder](https://github.com/parthit/ARApps-/tree/master/GREETINGCARD/ImageTargets) and scan an image. 
An audio file will start playing and a small promotion for my mother's bakery's instagram page will show up.
